        This is a project in the subject IN1060 User-oriented design at my second semester at the
        University of Oslo.  
        Our task was to plan and execute a project in which
        we designed and built a tangible digital prototype (without the use of a
        screen), for a selected user group. We chose public libraries as the
        research domain and developed a digital prototype for the public
        libraries' existing retrieval shelf solution.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        The project focused mainly on UX-design but with a user-oriented design
        angle, where the users were in focus. To gain insight into the early
        phase, we conducted observations at the various public libraries as well
        as in-depth interviews with domain experts about existing solution at
        the libraries. Next, we conducted semi-structured interviews and
        presentation of sketches to a selected user group. After interviewing
        domain experts for the second time, we concluded based on users' needs
        to develop a digital solution for the existing solution when retrieving
        books.

        The project consisted of seven iterations, we designed a modular
        prototype that allowed us to add new functionality and modify the
        prototype each iteration. An iteration of the project consisted of
        development of the prototype based on user needs, which we obtained
        during user testing. We had a selected user group, who followed us
        throughout the project. Each iteration was completed with an evaluation
        of the iterations prototype together with the user group.

        My role in this project was technically responsible, it involves writing
        the code for the technical solution. The solution is developed with the
        Arduino Uno microcontroller, the code is written in Arduino's own
        programming language, with a syntax who looks something like a crossing
        between Java and C++. As I had no experience with Arduino it brought
        with it some challenges, like knowing if an error was programmatic or
        hardware related. Besides the coding I have connected the entire circuit
        that makes up the solution. Furthermore, in line with the other members
        of the group, I conducted observations, data collection in the form of
        interviews and user tests iteratively.

      <p class="text">
        The final prototype design is a standard shelf equipped with two RFID
        readers, one reader integrated into the bookshelf partition and reading
        the book ID, as all the books at the libraries has individually
        RFID-tags. The second RFID reader is a card reader that reads the RFID
        card ID (which is to illustrate a loan card), the card reader is
        equipped with a led strip that flashes green if your book is in the
        shelf and red if it is not there. If the book is in the shelf and the
        correct loan card is registered, an LED strip light’s up which shelf
        section the book is in.

        It was a lot of
        fun to be thrown into such a project. It was educational to have such
        user-involved approach and I learned a lot about data collection, data
        analysis and user testing as well as how to work together in a team on a
        project. The role as technical responsible presented several challenges,
        especially getting three Arduino’s and two RFID readers to interact. The
        project was very motivating, and I learned a lot of programming, and
        about the power of using a microcontroller as a prototyping tool in
        UX-designing.
